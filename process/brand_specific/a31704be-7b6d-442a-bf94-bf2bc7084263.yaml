- Avoid making it seem like getting care through the platform is 'easy'. It can be 'simple' or 'convenient' or 'accessible' or 'affordable'\n
- Never guarantee a prescription would be given. Always say 'if prescribed' or ' connect with a provider through Hims platform to see if a prescription is right for you' \n
- Use words like 'treat', 'feel better', 'improve', 'reduce', 'help' instead of words like 'conquer', 'defeat', 'beat', 'overcome', 'resolve', 'cure', 'heal', 'leave behind'.\n
- Avoid saying medication cures all symptoms of anxiety or depression. Instead, say medication can 'treat' and 'reduce' symptoms.\n
- Avoid using 'will' and make no guarantees that everyone can get a treatment plan. Instead, acknowledge that 'a licensed provider can determine the best approach"
